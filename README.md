# Share-Memory-in-Message-Passing-System
This is a simple implementation of "H. Attiya, A. Bar-Nov and D. Dolev. “Sharing memory robustly in message-passing systems,” J. ACM, vol. 42, no. 1, pp. 124-142, Jan., 1995 [Online]. Available: https://dl.acm.org/"

The implementation is only the client side.
San Jose State University students should not copy any part of codes for homeworks. The action violates the academic integraty.
